    <article><h2>So We are going to present you the one and only guys who wasted their 18 months like nothing (first 9 months in the womb of their mothers and other 9 months in theri coaching center in class 12th) </h2>
        <p>SAV Classes, the ultimate trio of bakchod legends—Arsh, Abhinav, and Bhanu—were the kings of epic chutiyapa. These three chaman chutiyas went to coaching together, but studying? Fuck that! They were too busy pulling off top-tier bakchodi, cracking dirty jokes, and fucking around in the back benches. From bunking classes to irritating the shit out of their teachers with chodu pranks, these laude had a blast. Every day was a new level of haramipanti—stealing samosas, making fart noises in class, and laughing like madarchods. These gandu psychos didn’t care about books; they drowned in dark, twisted bakchodi, fantasizing about their crushes or exes while plotting sick stunts. They’d slip lewd sketches into notes, pull creepy pranks, and cackle like deranged bastards. Bunking to scheme in shadowy corners, spiking drinks with shady shit, and stealing snacks fueled their chaos. Teachers dreaded their unhinged energy, but SAV Classes thrived in their fucked-up world. Studying was for losers; their bond, forged in obsessive lust and demented antics, made their legendary haramipanti untouchable.</p></article></div>
